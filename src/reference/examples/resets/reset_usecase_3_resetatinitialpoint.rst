Usecase: Reset at initial point
-------------------------------

**Description:** This example shows that reset evaluation can happen throughout the simulation, including the very beginning. 

.. container:: shortlist

    Note that:

    - all elements are in the same component;
    - the order values of resets are not shown;
    - all variables have :code:`dimensionless` units;
    - the initial conditions hold when :code:`t = 0`.

+-----+-------+-----+-----+
| *t* | 0.0   | 0.1 | ... | 
+-----+-------+-----+-----+
| *x* | 0     | 0.1 | ... |

| *y* | 0 → 1 | 1   | ... | 
+-----+-------+-----+-----+

- **Cycle 1**

    1. At :code:`t = 0` we detect that :code:`x == 0`, so rule 1 becomes active.
    #. The reset value for rule 1 is calculated to be 1.
    #. The reset value for rule 1 is applied to :code:`y`.
    #. The system is now in a new state: :math:`(x^\prime, t, p) \neq (x, t, p)`, we restart at step 1.

- **Cycle 2**

    1. Since it is still true that :code:`x == 0`, rule 1 is still active.
    2. The reset value for rule 1 is (again) calculated to be 1.
    3. The reset value for rule 1 is (again) applied to :code:`y`.
    4. The state hasn't changed: :math:`(x^\prime, t, p) == (x, t, p)`, so reset rule 1 processing halts.

- **Cycle 3**

    1. No other resets are found to be active, so the reset evaluation cycles finish and model dynamics continue.

+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+
| *t* | 0.0   | 0.1 | ... | 0.9 | 1.0   | 1.1 | ... |
+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+
| *x* | 0     | 0.1 | ... | 0.9 | 1.0   | 1.1 | ... |
+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+
| *y* | 0 → 1 | 1   | ... | 1   | 1 → 0 | 0   | ... |
+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+

- **Cycle 4** 

    1. At :code:`t = 1` we detect that :code:`x == 1`, so rule 2 becomes active.
    2. The reset value for rule 2 is calculated to be 0.
    3. The reset value for rule 2 is applied to :code:`y`.
    4. The system is now in a new state: :math:`(x^\prime, t, p) \neq (x, t, p)`, so restart.

- **Cycle 5**

    1. Since it is still true that :code:`x == 1`, rule 2 is still active.
    2. The reset value for rule 2 is calculated (still) to be 0.
    3. And reset value for rule 2 is applied to :code:`y`.
    4. The state hasn't changed: :math:`(x^\prime, t, p) == (x, t, p)`, so reset rule 2 processing halts.

- **Cycle 6**

    1. No other resets are found to be active, so the reset evaluation cycles finish and model dynamics continue.
