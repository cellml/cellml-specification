      Understanding reset elements

    Resets are a new addition to CellML in version 2.0, and their intention is to allow the user to specify how and when discontinuities can exist in variable values throughout the solution.
    A reset lets you set a variable to a totally different value, restart a timer, flip a switch, take a step, start again.
    In order to work, a reset needs to know some information:

    - **Which variable's value do you want to change?**
      This is called the "reset variable" and is specified by the :code:`variable` attribute in the :code:`reset` block.
    - **Which variable will tell us when to trigger the change?**
      This is called the "test variable" and is referenced by the :code:`test_variable` attribute in the :code:`reset` block.
      The test variable can be the same as the reset variable.
    - **What happens if more than one reset points to the same reset variable?**
      This will be sorted out by the unique :code:`order` attribute on each :code:`reset` element which changes this reset variable.
      The order will determine which of the active competing resets is applied.
    - **What new value should be given to the reset variable?**
      This is called the "reset value" and is specified by evaluating the MathML content which is inside the :code:`reset_value` element child of this :code:`reset` element.
    - **What value of the test variable should be used to trigger the change?**
      This is called the "test value" and is specified by evaluating the MathML content inside the :code:`test_value` element child of this :code:`reset` element.

    Some of the syntax is explained below in the "see more" sections, and a final example is given at the end.
    For a much more thorough discussion and examples of resets in different scenarios, please see the
    :numref:`Interpretation of resets <specC_interpretation_of_resets>` section.
