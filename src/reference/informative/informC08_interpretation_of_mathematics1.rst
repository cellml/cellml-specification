      What is a "pertinent component"?

    Pertinent components are those which together form the entirety of the model.
    They could be locally defined within the :code:`model` itself, imported from a separate file, or a dependency within the encapsulated set of an imported component.
    The example below describes a game of cricket in the backyard of a boy called Tom (defined locally).  
    He imports a boy called Harry from next door, but Harry's dog Dick comes along too as an implicit import because the component :code:`DickTheDog` is encapsulated as a child of the component :code:`Harry` in the :code:`Neighbours.cellml` file.
    All three components :code:`Tom`, :code:`DickTheDog`, and :code:`Harry` are "pertinent component items" to the :code:`BackyardCricket` model.
    The component :code:`George`, also in the :code:`Neighbours.cellml` file is not pertinent, as it is not within the encapsulated set of the imported component :code:`Harry`.

    .. code::

      file: MyHouse.cellml
        └─ model: BackyardCricket
            └─ component: FirstGame
                ├─ component: Tom (locally defined)                        
                └─ component: Harry  <╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴┐            
                    └─ component: DickTheDog      ╷
                                               explicitly importing Harry will
      file: Neighbours.cellml                  implicitly import DickTheDog
        └─ model: HarrysHouse                     ╵
            ├─ component: Harry  ╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴╴┬╴╴╴╴┘   
            │   └─ component: DickTheDog ╴╴╴╴┘ 
            └─ component: George

          <!-- The local encapsulation structure does not affect which components are pertinent. -->

            <component_ref component="FirstGame" >
              <component_ref component="Tom" />
              <component_ref component="Harry" />

        <model name="HarrysHouse" >
          <component name="Harry" />

          <!-- Pertinent: An implicitly imported component, pertinent because of its presence 
              in the encapsulated set of an imported component. -->
          <component name="DickTheDog" />

          <!-- Not pertinent: George is not a pertinent component item to the
              BackyardCricket model as it is neither explicitly nor implicitly imported. -->
          <component name="George" />

          <!-- The encapsulation set means that DickTheDog is a pertinent component item, 
              as it is imported at the same time as the component Harry is imported. -->
          <encapsulation>
            <component_ref component="Harry" >
              <component_ref component="DickTheDog" />
            </component_ref>
          </encapsulation>
        </model>

    After we know which components are pertinent, we can retrieve their mathematical contents (i.e.: the pertinent components' :code:`math` elements) and use these in the broader BackyardCricket model.
