      Understanding how the units work

    **Within a component:**
    We know that units in real life make a big difference, but *within* a CellML component, they don't.
    Units in equations are provided to help the user find bugs, and each :code:`variable` element has to specify a corresponding :code:`units` element, but these combinations don't affect the validity of the :code:`math` element.
    They do make a difference to how your model may to be interpreted, and can help you to find errors or inconsistencies in your mathematical definitions.

    Some examples are shown below.

    1. Constants and variables in an equation have different units: this is not invalid CellML, but doesn't make any mathematical sense.

      .. code-block:: xml

        <variable name="lunch" units="omelette" />
        ...
        <apply><eq/>
          <ci>lunch</ci>
          <apply><plus/>
            <cn cellml:units="egg">2</cn>
            <cn cellml:units="cheese">5</cn>
            <cn cellml:units="milk">0.1</cn>
          </apply>
        </apply>

    2. Exponents have units other than :code:`dimensionless`: again, not invalid CellML, but mathematical nonsense.

      .. code-block:: xml

        <variable name="E" units="joule" />
        <variable name="m" units="kilogram" />
        <variable name="c" units="metres_per_second" />
        ...
        <apply><eq/>
          <ci>E</ci>
          <apply><times/>
            <ci>m</ci>
            <apply></power>
              <ci>c</ci>
              <cn cellml:units="anything_not_dimensionless">2</cn>
            </apply>
          </apply>
        </apply>
  
    **Between components:**
    Components were designed to promote modularity and reuse of models, so it's important that those re-users understand what they're getting into. 
    This is why equivalent variables (those connected across components) must have the same :ref:`unit reduction<specC_equivalent_variables_units>`, so that whatever the inner workings of a component are, the external users of that component are able to interpret them correctly.

    The only situation in which :code:`units` items are compared to one another is between equivalent variables, i.e.: the :code:`variable_1` and :code:`variable_2` attributes of a :code:`map_variables` element.
    Here, both of the :code:`variable` elements referenced must have the same :ref:`unit reduction<_informC03_interpretation_of_units_3_2>`, though not necessarily the same multiplication factor.
    Some examples of these are shown below.
    
    1. Any custom or built-in units with differing scaling factors between connected variables: valid, as the unit reduction is the same, but the resulting mathematics will need to be interpreted carefully!

      .. code::

        model: DCUniverse
          ├─ component: Metropolis
          │   └─ variable: Superman (units = megapowers) <╴╴┐
          │                                                 ╷
          │                                       connected variables
          ├─ component: Smallville                          ╵
          │   └─ variable: ClarkKent (units = micropowers) ╴┘
          │
          └─ units: powers
              ├─ units: micropowers = 0.000001*powers
              └─ units: megapowers = 1,000,000*powers

        .. code-block:: xml

          <model name="DCUniverse">
            <!-- Defining a custom base unit called "powers". -->
            <units name="powers" />
            <!-- Creating the derived custom units with different prefixes,

            </component>

            </component>
            <!-- The connection is valid, because the unit reduction is the same,
                even though the multiplication factor between the two variables
                is different. -->
            <connection component_1="Metropolis" component_2="Smallville">
              <map_variables variable_1="Superman" variable_2="ClarkKent" />
            </connection>
          </model>

    2. Any custom of built-in units with *differing* unit reduction tuples between connected variables: invalid, as it contradicts point :hardcodedref:`3.10.6` in the :ref:`Interpretation of map_variables<specC_interpretation_of_map_variables>` section.  
       Please see the third informative block on the :ref:`Interpretation of units<specC_interpretation_of_units>` section for more discussion and examples of unit reductions.

    In summary, the only place in which units can cause validation errors related to variables are between equivalent variables (variables connected using :code:`connection` and :code:`map_variables` elements):

    - :code:`x` [Volts] equivalent to :code:`y` [Amps] : **invalid**, conflicting unit reductions;
    - :code:`x` [Volts] equivalent to :code:`y` [millivolts] : **valid**, unit reductions are the same even though the scaling factor is different; 
    - in the :code:`math` element :code:`x` [Volts] = :code:`y` [Amps]: **valid** (but nonsense); 
    - in the :code:`math` element :code:`x` [Volts] = 3 [Amps]: **valid** (but nonsense).
