    Because MathML is an entire language in its own right, we just don't have the ability to go through all its general aspects here.
    Some great general resources are available on the :mathml2help:`MathML 2.0 site <#id.4.2.1.3>`, and we'll discuss below the more CellML specific restrictions in the other "See more" sections.

    **Please note** that MathML 2 content markup is the only syntax used in CellML, even though more recent versions (MathML 3 and MathML 4) are available.
